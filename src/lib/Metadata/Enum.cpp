// This file defines the merging of different types of infos. The data in the
// calling Info is preserved during a merge unless that field is empty or
// default. In that case, the data from the parameter Info is used to replace
// the empty or default data.
//
// For most fields, the first decl seen provides the data. Exceptions to this
// include the location and description fields, which are collections of data on
// all decls related to a given definition. All other fields are ignored in new
// decls unless the first seen decl didn't, for whatever reason, incorporate
// data on that field (e.g. a forward declared class wouldn't have information
// on members on the forward declaration, but would have the class name).
