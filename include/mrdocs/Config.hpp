/** Configuration used to generate the Corpus and Docs

    This contains all the public settings applied
    from the command line and the YML file (if any).

    This class stores the original and public config
    options as they are passed to MrDocs, in their original
    data types, such as strings and bools.

    This class is an abstract interface whose private
    concrete implementation typically includes these
    parsed configuration values in a more convenient form
    for use by MrDocs.

    Meanwhile, this class is provided publicly to plugins.

    The configuration is always connected to the
    directory of the mrdocs.yml file from which
    absolute paths are calculated from relative paths.
