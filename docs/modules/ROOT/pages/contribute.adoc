= Contributor's Guide

This page contains information for contributors to the Mr.Docs project.
It is intended to provide an overview of the codebase and the process of adding new features.

== Codebase Overview

The Mr.Docs codebase is divided into several modules:

include::partial$workflow.adoc[]

This section provides an overview of each module and how they interact with each other in the Mr.Docs codebase.

[#options]
=== Parsing options

Mr.Docs options affect the behavior of the compilation database, how symbols are extracted, and how the documentation is generated.
They are parsed from the command line and configuration file.

The main entry point of Mr.Docs is the `DoGenerateAction` function in `src/tool/GenerateAction.cpp`.
It loads the options, creates the compilation database, and runs the extraction and generation steps.
The options are formed from a combination of command line arguments and configuration file settings.

==== Command Line Options

Command line and common options are defined in `src/tool/ToolArgs.hpp`.
The `ToolArgs` class uses the `llvm::cl` library to define and parse the command line arguments.

==== Configuration File

Common options are defined in `mrdocs/Config.hpp`.
The `Config` class represents all public options that could be defined in a configuration file.
It also provides a representation plugins can use to access public options from the command line or configuration file.

The function `clang::mrdocs::loadConfig` is also provided to parse all public options from a YAML configuration file.

Internally, Mr.Docs uses the derived `clang::mrdocs::ConfigImpl` class (`src/lib/Lib/ConfigImpl.hpp`) to also store the private representation of parsed options, such as filters.

==== Finalizing Options

Common options are stored in the `Config` class, while the `ToolArgs` class stores common options and the command line options.
For instance, the `config` option can only be set from the command line, as it would be illogical to expect the location of the configuration file to be defined in the configuration file itself.
On the other hand, the `output` option can be set from both the command line and the configuration file so that the user can define a default output location in the configuration file.

Thus, after the command line and configuration file options are parsed, they are finalized in the `DoGenerateAction` function by calling `ToolArgs::apply`, which overrides the configuration file options in `Config` with the command line options, when applicable.

As a last step, `DoGenerateAction` converts the public `Config` settings into a `ConfigImpl` object, which is used by the rest of the program with the parsed options.

[#representing_symbols]
== Representing Symbols

MrDocs has many categories of objects, where we utilize polymorphism with a fixed set of valid derived types, including Symbols (functions, classes, and enums), Javadoc blocks, template parameters, template arguments, and data types. For each such family, we follow a consistent file layout. Most of these families are defined in the `mrdocs/Metadata` directory.

Each base class is defined in its own header and, when necessary, implementation file. Each derived class also has its own header and implementation file. Finally, there is a single aggregator header file that includes all the derived headers. This file centralizes logic that requires knowledge of the full set of variants, such as visitors, comparison operators, and other operations that depend on the discriminator.

This pattern keeps the individual derived types self-contained while making cross-variant operations explicit and localized. When adding a new derived type, contributors should create its header and source file alongside the existing ones and update the corresponding aggregator file to register the new variant. This keeps the codebase predictable, avoids scattering logic, and ensures that operations over polymorphic families remain easy to find and maintain.

[#extract_symbols]
=== Extracting Symbols

At this stage, the clang frontend is used to parse the source code and generate an AST.
The AST information is extracted and stored in a `Corpus` object (`mrdocs/Corpus.hpp`).

[#compilation_database]
==== Compilation Database

The second step in `DoGenerateAction` is to create a `CompilationDatabase` object, so we can extract symbols from its source files.
There are multiple possible sources for this file according to the configuration options: the file might be read directly from the path specified in the options, or it might be generated by Mr.Docs from build scripts.

Whatever the source, a derived `Mr.DocsCompilationDatabase` object (`lib/Lib/Mr.DocsCompilationDatabase.hpp`) is created to represent the compilation database.
The difference between the original `CompilationDatabase` and the `MrDocsCompilationDatabase` is that the latter includes a number of pre-processing steps to filter and transform compilation commands.

For each compilation command:

* Command line arguments are adjusted
** Warnings are supressed
** Additional defines are added
** Implicit include directories are added
** Unrecognized arguments are removed
* Paths are normalized
* Non C++ files are filtered

[#info_nodes]
==== Info Nodes

MrDocs represents each C++ symbol or construct as an `Info` node (`mrdocs/Metadata/Info.hpp`).
`Info` can not only represent direct AST symbols but also {cpp} constructs that need to be inferred from these symbols.
Nodes in the first category will typically be created in the initial extraction step, and nodes in the second category will be created in the finalization step.

When defining a new `Info` type, it is important to consider how this type will be supported in all other modules of the codebase, including the AST visitor, generators, tests, and the documentation.
The script `.github/check_info_nodes_support.sh` will attempt to infer whether most of these features have been implemented for each node type.

==== Clang LibTooling

MrDocs uses Clang to extract `Info` objects from the {cpp} AST.
Clang offers two https://clang.llvm.org/docs/Tooling.html[interfaces] to access the C++ AST: the https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/group__CINDEX.html[`LibClang`] and https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibTooling.html[`LibTooling`] libraries.
MrDocs uses the latter, as it provides full control over the AST traversal process at the cost of an unstable API.

In LibTooling, once we have a <<compilation_database>>, we can create a `ClangTool` object to run the Clang frontend on a set of source files.

[source,c++]
----
clang::tooling::ClangTool Tool(compilationDatabase, sourceFiles);
newFrontendActionFactory<clang::SyntaxOnlyAction> actionFactory();
return Tool.run(actionFactory.get());
----

The `clang::tooling::ClangTool::run` method takes a `clang::tooling::ToolAction` object that defines how to process the AST.
The action object usually comes from a `clang::tooling::FrontendActionFactory`.
In the example above, the `SyntaxOnlyAction` is used to parse the source code and generate the AST without any further processing.

In MrDocs, this process happens in `clang::mrdocs::CorpusImpl::build` (`src/lib/Lib/CorpusImpl.cpp`), where we call `Tool.run` for each object in the database with our custom `ASTAction` action and `ASTActionFactory` factory (`src/lib/AST/ASTVisitor.cpp`).

==== AST Traversal

While `ASTAction` is the entry point for processing the AST, the real work is done by the `ASTVisitor` class.
As the AST is generated, it is traversed by the `ASTVisitor` class.

The entry point of this class is `ASTVisitor::build`, which recursively calls `ASTVisitor::traverseDecl` for the root `clang::TranslationUnitDecl` node of the translation unit.
During the AST traversal stage, the complete AST generated by the clang frontend is walked beginning with this root `TranslationUnitDecl` node.

Each `clang` node is converted into a `<<info_nodes,mrdocs::Info>>` node, which is then stored with any relevant information in a `mrdocs::Corpus` object.

==== USR Generation

It is during this stage that USRs (universal symbol references) are generated and hashed with SHA1 to form the 160 bit `SymbolID` for an entity.
Except for built-in types, *all* entities referenced in the corpus will be traversed and be assigned a `SymbolID`; including those from the standard library.
This is necessary to generate the full interface for user-defined types.

==== Finalizing the Corpus

After running the AST traversal on all translation units, `CorpusImpl::build` contains finalization steps for the `Corpus` object.
At this point, we process C++ constructs that are not directly represented in the AST.

The first finalization step happens in `CorpusImpl::build` (`src/lib/Lib/CorpusImpl.cpp`), where the `Info` objects from a single translation unit
are merged into a map containing the merged results from all other TUs.
The merging step is necessary as there may be multiple identical definitions of the same entity.
For instance, this represents the case where a function is declared at different points in the code base and might have different attributes or comments.
At this step, the doc comments are also finalized.
Each `Info` object has a pointer to its `Javadoc`  object (`mrdocs/Metadata/Javadoc.hpp`), which is a representation of the documentation comments.

After AST traversal and `Info` merging, the result is stored as a map of `Info` objects indexed by their respective `SymbolID`.
A second finalization step is then performed in `clang::mrdocs::finalize`, where any references to `SymbolID` objects that don't exist are removed.
This is necessary because the AST traversal will generate references to entities that should be filtered and are not present in the corpus.

At this point, the `Corpus` object contains representations of all entities in the code base and further semantic {cpp} constructs that are not directly represented in the AST can be inferred.

=== Generators

Documentation generators may traverse this structure by calling `Corpus::traverse` with a `Corpus::Visitor` derived visitor and the `SymbolID` of the entity to visit (e.g. the global namespace).

Documentation generators are responsible for traversing the corpus and generating documentation in the desired format.

The API for documentation generators is defined in `mrdocs/Generator.hpp`.

== Polymorphism

== Coding Standards

=== Paths

The AST visitor and metadata all use forward slashes to represent file pathnames, even on Windows.
This is so the generated reference documentation does not vary based on the platform.

=== Exceptions

Errors thrown by the program should always have type `Exception`.
Objects of this type are capable of transporting an `Error` object.
This is important for the scripting to work; exceptions are used to propagate errors from library code to scripts and back to the invoking code.
For exceptional cases, these thrown exceptions should be uncaught.
The tool installs an uncaught exception handler that prints a stack trace and exits the process immediately.

=== Testing

All new features should be accompanied by tests.
The `mrdocs-test` target is used to run the test suites.
This target has its entry point in `src/test/TestMain.cpp`, which can take two paths:

* Golden testing: When input paths are provided to the test executable via the command line, the test suite will run the `DoTestAction()` that iterates all files in `test-files` comparing the input source files with the expected XML output files.
* Unit testing: When no input paths are provided, all unit tests will be run via `unit_test_main()`, defined by our test-suite library in `src/test_suite/test_suite.cpp`.

The fixtures for golden testing are defined in `test-files/golden-tests`, where files in each directory have the following format:

* `mrdocs.yml`: Basic configuration options for all files in this directory.
* `<filename>.cpp`: The input source file to extract symbols from.
* `<filename>.xml`: The expected XML output file generated with the XML generator.
* `<filename>.bad.xml`: The test output file generated when the test fails.
* `<filename>.yml`: Extra configuration options for this specific file.

== Style Guide

This project follows informal formatting conventions established by previous Boost projects.
To help contributors, we provide a `.clang-format` file that encodes these rules.

* Do *not* apply clang-format across entire files or the whole project.
* Use the config only as a *reference* for your IDE/editor, or to format the code you **personally add or modify** in a commit.
* Always check the surrounding code and keep consistent with it.
* Do not create style-only commits that introduce large diffs without functional changes.

Why This Approach:

* Keeps history clean: avoids large, style-only commits.
* Ensures new contributors are not lost when adapting to project style.
* Encourages consistency without rigid automation.

General Advice: When in doubt, copy the style of the surrounding code. The `.clang-format` file is a tool to help you, not a rule to enforce blindly.

The utility script `./util/reformat.sh` can also be used to check a few project invariants, such as header guards and include order.
