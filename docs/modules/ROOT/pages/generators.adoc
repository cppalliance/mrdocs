= Generators

MrDocs uses a generator to convert the extracted symbols into documentation.
MrDocs supports multiple output formats that can be specified via the `generate` option:

The `generate` option can be used to specify the output format:

[source,yaml]
----
# ...
generate: adoc
# ...
----

Three output formats are supported:

|===
|Format |Description

|`adoc`
|AsciiDoc format.

|`html`
|HTML format.

|`xml`
|XML format.
|===

The corpus of symbols is provided to the generator responsible for converting these symbols into the desired output format.

The `xml` generator is used as an intermediary format for other tools or for testing purposes.
Users can write their own tools to process the XML output and generate custom documentation.

The `adoc` and `html` generators use templates to generate the documentation.
These templates can be customized to change the output format and style.

Asciidoc is a text-based format that is easy to read and write.
It can also be converted to other formats such as HTML and Markdown.

HTML can be generated directly with the `html` format.

== Choosing the Right Generator

The scatter plot below illustrates the available output formats for MrDocs, along with hypothetical solutions, in terms of **redundancy** and **convenience**.

image::generator_front.svg[Output Formats Scatter Plot,width=600]

- **Redundancy**: The amount of duplicated or unstructured information in the output format.
Lower redundancy is generally preferred for post-processing, while higher redundancy can allow the output to use formats that are easier to use directly.
- **Convenience**: Reflects how readily the output format can be used without requiring additional tools or steps.

Although Clang can generate and print an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) directly for a Translation Unit (TU), it is not the most convenient format for generating documentation:

- It does not provide the AST in a format that's easy to process.
- Equivalent symbols can be redeclared multiple times in the same translation unit and across translation units.
- The documentation for equivalent symbols also needs to be unified.

The scatter plot shows the following output formats supported by MrDocs:

1. **XML**: Aggregates all symbols and their documentation in a format that is straightforward to process.
It's suitable for advanced use cases involving custom post-processing tools.
2. **Asciidoc**: Similar to HTML in convenience, Asciidoc files can be easily converted to HTML and multiple other formats with https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/convert/available/:[backends].
3. **HTML**: Generates output that is directly usable in a variety of contexts, such as web pages or documentation systems.

The Asciidoc and HTML generators also support <<generator-templates,*Custom Templates*>> to change the output format and style.
This forms another possibility in the trade-off between redundancy and convenience.

The best trade-offs, represented by the line passing through the generators, indicate the optimal solutions in terms of redundancy and convenience.
Solutions on this line balance these goals effectively.
Dots in the background represent other potential formats that do not lie on the front of best trade-offs, as they fail to optimize either redundancy or convenience compared to the available generators.

[#generator-templates]
== Generator Templates

MrDocs attempts to support various alternatives for customizing the output format and style without complex workflows to post-process XML output.
The `adoc` and `html` generators use https://handlebarsjs.com/[Handlebars,window=_blank] templates.
These templates can be customized to change the output format and style of the documentation.

The templates used to generate the documentation are located in the `share/mrdocs/addons/generator` directory.
Users can create a copy of these files and provide their own `addons` directory via the `addons` option in the configuration file or via the command line.

[source,yaml]
----
addons: /path/to/custom/addons
----

Each symbol goes through a main layout template in the `<addons>/generator/<generator>/layouts/single-symbol.<generator>.hbs` directory.
This template is a simple entry point that renders the partial relative to the symbol kind.

The partials are located in the `<addons>/generator/<generator>/partials` directory.
It typically contains the following files and subdirectories:

* `symbol`: A generic partial for rendering symbols.
* `location`: Partials for rendering <<location-fields,location objects>>.
* `symbol`: Partials for rendering <<symbol-fields,Symbol Objects>>.
* `template`: Partials for rendering <<template-info-fields,Template Info Objects>>.
* `type`: Partials for rendering <<type-info-fields,Type Info Objects>>.
* `markup`: partials for rendering markup elements such as lists, tables, and code blocks, in the output format.

Please refer to the <<dom_reference,Document Object Model Reference>> for more information on each type of object.

Partials common to all generators are available in the `<addons>/generator/common/partials` directory.
The common partials are loaded before the generator-specific partials, which can override any common partials.

The multipage generator renders the layout multiple times as separate pages for each symbol.
The single-page generator renders the layout multiple times and concatenates the results in a single page.

Each time the generator encounters a symbol, it renders the layout template with the symbol data as the Handlebars context.
The layout template can include other partial templates to render the symbol data. These partials are available in the `<addons>/generator/<generator>/partials` directory.

The Document Object Model (DOM) for each symbol includes all information about the symbol.One advantage of custom templates over post-processing XML files is the ability to access symbols as a graph.If symbol `A` refers to symbol `B`, some properties of symbol `B` are likely to be required in the documentation of `A`.All templates and generators can access a reference to `B` by searching the symbol tree or simply by accessing the elements `A` refers to.All references to other symbols are resolved in the templates.

[#dom_reference]
== Document Object Model Reference

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a tree structure that represents the symbols extracted from the source code.The DOM is used by the generator to render the documentation.
