[#mrdocs-binaries]
== Binaries

Binary packages are available from our https://github.com/cppalliance/mrdocs/releases[Release Page,window="_blank"]

== Source

Clone the MrDocs repository with:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/cppalliance/mrdocs
----

Also create and go to the `third-party` directory, where we are going to download and install our dependencies:

[source,bash]
----
mkdir third-party
cd third-party
----

[NOTE]
====
These instructions assume all dependencies are installed in the `third-party` directory for simplicity.
Fell free to install them anywhere you want and adjust the main MrDocs configuration command later.

=== Installing LLVM

MrDocs uses LLVM to parse C++ code and extract documentation from it.
It depends on a recent version of LLVM: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/29b20829cc6ce3e6d9c3809164994c1659e0da56[29b20829]

[#llvm-binaries]
**Binaries**:

Because building LLVM may take many hours to complete, we provide pre-built binaries for Windows and Linux:

IMPORTANT: The Linux binaries are built on Ubuntu 22.04 and may not work on other distributions.

You can download the binaries and uncompress them in the `./third-party/llvm+clang` directory we created in the previous step.

LLVM binaries are provided in a number of preset configurations.
Here is a brief description of each preset:

- `Release`: this is the preset users will typically use.
It is optimized for speed and does not include debug information.
- `Debug`: this is a preset developers can use.
It includes debug information and no optimizations.
However, using a `Debug` build of LLVM to debug MrDocs might be too slow.
In this case, you can link MrDocs with `RelWithDebInfo` or `DebWithOpt`.
- `RelWithDebInfo`: this is a release build with debug information.
It is optimized for speed and includes debug information.
However, if you are working with Windows+MSVC, this preset has a `Release` build type at the MSVC level.
This means you can have conflicts with MrDocs in `Debug` mode because of LLVM setting flags such as the `_ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL` and `/MDd`.
In this case, you can use `DebWithOpt` instead to avoid the conflict and subsequent workarounds.
- `DebWithOpt`: this is a debug build with optimizations.
It includes all the default Debug flags for LLVM, it's optimized for speed, includes debug information, and causes no conflicts with MrDocs in `Debug` mode.

If you chose to use the provided binaries instead of building LLVM from source, you can skip to the <<duktape>> section.

**Download**:

Alternatively, if building LLVM from source, you can clone the project from the official repository:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git
cd llvm-project
git checkout 29b20829cc6ce3e6d9c3809164994c1659e0da56
cd llvm
----

**Configure**:

There are two ways to configure LLVM: using <<llvm-configure-presets, CMake presets>> or using <<llvm-configure-cmd-line, CMake directly>>.

[#llvm-configure-presets]
_Configure with CMake Presets_

We recommend using https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-presets.7.html[CMake presets,window=_blank] to build LLVM.
Preset files contain a replicable set of CMake configuration values that can be used to configure a project.

Instead of passing all CMake configuration values on the command line, a template for the `CMakePresets.json` and `CMakeUserPresets.json` files is provided in the repository's `third-party/llvm` directory.
Copy these files to the `llvm-project/llvm` directory and run a command such as the following to configure LLVM:

[source,bash]
----
cmake -preset=relwithdebinfo-win
----

In the example above, we configure a `RelWithDebInfo` version of LLVM for MrDocs: a release build with debug information.

Choose one of the presets from `CMakePresets.json` or edit the variants in `CMakeUserPresets.json` to customize the configurations.
The `CMakeUserPresets.json` file comes with presets for all the configurations described in the <<llvm-binaries,Binaries>> section.

[NOTE]
====
Developers might also want to build a custom `Debug` LLVM configuration including optimizations, which allows for faster execution of tests.
The `relwithdebinfo` and `debwithopt` presets are provided for this purpose.
Or if you prefer using the command line, set `CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES` or `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` to `Debug` and manually include the optimization flags to `-D CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="/O2 /Zi"` (MSVC) or `-D CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-Og -g"`.

This should give you an optimized build with all debug features and flags, such as an appropriate https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/standard-library/iterator-debug-level[`_ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL`] and the `/MDd` flag in MSVC.
In other platforms, this should give you a release somewhat equivalent to `RelWithDebInfo` optimized for debugging experience. `-Og` offers a reasonable level of optimization while maintaining fast compilation and a good debugging experience.
====

[#llvm-configure-cmd-line]
_Configure with Command Line Arguments_:

You can also configure LLVM directly with the settings required by MrDocs:

Windows (from administrator `cmd.exe`, after running `vcvars64.bat`):

[source,commandline]
----
cmake -S llvm -B build/MSVC/RelWithDebInfo -G "Ninja" -A x64 -D LLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang" -D CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES="RelWithDebInfo" -D LLVM_ENABLE_RTTI=ON -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../llvm+clang/RelWithDebInfo -D LLVM_ENABLE_IDE=OFF -D LLVM_ENABLE_DIA_SDK=OFF
----

Unix variants:

[source,bash]
----
cmake -S llvm -B build/Linux/RelWithDebInfo -D LLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang" -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -D LLVM_ENABLE_RTTI=ON -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../llvm+clang/RelWithDebInfo
----

Unlike the <<llvm-configure-presets,CMake presets>>, this command does not a number of parameters that removes features that are not required by MrDocs, thus increasing the build time and size of the installation.

**Build**:

Build and install the configured version of LLVM with:

[source,bash]
----
cd build
cmake --build . --config RelWithDebInfo
cmake --install . --prefix ../../llvm+clang/RelWithDebInfo" --config RelWithDebInfo
----

If you prefer using the provided CMake presets, you can also use the `--preset` option for the `build` command:

[source,bash]
----
cd build
cmake --build --preset=relwithdebinfo-win
cmake --install MSVC/RelWithDebInfo --config RelWithDebInfo
----

Return from `./third-party/llvm-project/build` to the parent `third-party` directory to install other dependencies:

[source,bash]
----
cd ../..
----

=== CMake dependencies

All other dependencies provide CMake integration scripts and can be obtained from https://www.vcpkg.io/[vcpkg] or installed manually.

* `fmt` >= 10
* `duktape`

For development builds, which include tests, you will also need:

* `libxml2[tools]`

The instructions in this documentation will use vcpkg for these.

**Installing vcpkg**:

If you don't have vcpkg installed, clone the repository:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git -b master
cd vcpkg
----

and bootstrap it:

Windows:

[source,bash]
----
bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
----

Unix variants:

[source,bash]
----
./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
----

**Installing dependencies**:

vcpkg has two operation modes with which you can install these dependencies: <<vcpkg-classic-mode,classic mode>> and <<vcpkg-manifest-mode,manifest mode>>.

[#vcpkg-classic-mode]
_Classic mode_:

In vcpkg https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/users/classic-mode[classic mode,window=blank_], vcpkg maintains a central installed tree inside the vcpkg instance built up by individual `vcpkg install` and `vcpkg remove` commands.
This central set of packages can then be shared by any number of projects.
However, each instance of vcpkg (a separate git clone) will have its own set of packages installed.

To install these dependencies with vcpkg in classic mode:

Windows:

[source,bash]
----
vcpkg.exe fmt zlib libxml2[tools] --triplet x64-windows
----

Unix variants:

[source,bash]
----
./vcpkg fmt zlib libxml2[tools]
----

[#vcpkg-manifest-mode]
_Manifest mode_:

In https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/users/manifests[manifest mode,windows=blank_], you declare your project's direct dependencies in a manifest file named `vcpkg.json`.
MrDocs includes a `vcpkg.json.example` file you can duplicate or create a symlink as `vcpkg.json` to use this mode.
MrDocs is a CMake project that then already includes a `vcpkg.json` file, there's nothing else you need to run to install the dependencies.

In this mode, vcpkg will create separate installed trees for each project and configuration.
This is the recommended vcpkg mode for most users according to the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/users/manifests[vcpkg documentation,window=blank_].

=== MrDocs

Return from `./third-party/vcpkg` to the parent directory of `third-party` (the one containing the `mrdocs` directory) to build and install MrDocs:

[source,bash]
----
cd ../..
----

**Configure**:

You can also configure MrDocs with <<mrdocs-configure-cmd-line, command line arguments>> or <<mrdocs-configure-presets, CMake presets>>.

[#mrdocs-configure-cmd-line]
_Configure with Command Line Arguments_:

With the dependencies are available in `third-party`, you can configure MrDocs with:

Windows:

[source,commandline]
----
cmake -S mrdocs -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -D CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES="RelWithDebInfo" -D CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON -D LLVM_ROOT="%cd%/third-party/llvm+clang/RelWithDebInfo" -D DUKTAPE_SOURCE_ROOT="%cd%/third-party/duktape-2.7.0" -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="%cd%/third-party/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake"
----

Unix variants:

[source,bash]
----
cmake -S mrdocs -B build -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -D CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON -D LLVM_ROOT="$(pwd)/third-party/llvm+clang/RelWithDebInfo" -D DUKTAPE_SOURCE_ROOT="$(pwd)/third-party/duktape-2.7.0" -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="$(pwd)/third-party/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake"
----

[#mrdocs-configure-presets]
_Configure with CMake Presets_:

The MrDocs repository also includes a `CMakePresets.json` file that contains the parameters to configure MrDocs with CMake.

To specify the installation directories, you can use the `LLVM_ROOT`, `DUKTAPE_SOURCE_ROOT`, `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` environment variables.
To specify a generator (`-G`) and platform name (`-A`), you can use the `CMAKE_GENERATOR` and `CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM` environment variables.

You can also customize the presets by duplicating and editing the `CMakeUserPresets.json.example` file in the `mrdocs` directory.
This is typically more convenient than using environment variables.

**Build**:

Then build and install MrDocs with:

[source,bash]
----
cd build
cmake --build .
cmake --install .
----

To customize the installation directory, use the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` option or use the `--prefix` option for the `cmake --install .` command.
To customize the C and C++ compilers, use the `CMAKE_C_COMPILER` and `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` options.

[NOTE]
====
Developers should also enable `-D BUILD_TESTING=ON`.
If any custom build of LLVM other than `RelWithDebInfo` is being used, the `LLVM_ROOT` variable should be set to the installation directory of that build.
====

== Package layout

The MrDocs installation directory follows the "Filesystem Hierarchy Standard" (FHS) layout:

* `bin`: the MrDocs executable intended to be used by users or invoked from the command line.
* `share`: resource files installed by MrDocs
* `doc`: the MrDocs documentation
* `include`: the MrDocs headers
* `lib`: the MrDocs library

The FHS layout provides a directory structure that also serves as a widely accepted convention for organizing files and directories in Unix-like systems, but that can be used in any operating system.
