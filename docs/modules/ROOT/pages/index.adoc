== Comparison

=== Doxygen:

* tries to work for many languages
* use the inferior libclang API
* old program with lots of technical debt
* not written by me

=== MrDox:

* narrow and deep focus on {cpp} only
* uses clang's unstable libtooling API:
** Understands ALL C++: if clang can compile it, MrDox knows about it
** This includes up to {cpp}20 and even experimental things in {cpp}23
* brand-new program with no technical debt
* written by me
