- Automating {cpp} reference documentation significantly enhances usability by providing a navigable API and ensuring a single, up-to-date source of truth with minimal effort.
- However, documenting {cpp} poses significant challenges due to discrepancies between the codebase and the public API. Doxygen remains a popular tool, yet it is suboptimal for {cpp} as it fails to fully comprehend {cpp} constructs and requires many transformation steps, including the incorporation of many macros within the {cpp} code. These macros maintain well-formed and ill-formed versions of the code, undermining the goal of unifying the source of truth.
- Existing solutions frequently need better maintenance or usability issues, prompting users to revert to Doxygen.
- An ideal solution would inherently understand {cpp} constructs, be actively maintained, and offer diverse options for customizing the output format.
- MrDocs embodies these qualities. Supported by full-time developers from the {cpp} Alliance, MrDocs inherently comprehends {cpp} constructs without the need for macros and provides various output formats, customizable templates, and plugin support, ensuring it meets the demands of comprehensive and efficient documentation.
