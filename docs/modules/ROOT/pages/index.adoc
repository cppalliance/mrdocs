== Comparison

=== Doxygen:

* Tries to work for many languages
* Uses the inferior libclang API
* Old program with lots of technical debt
* Not written by me

=== MrDocs:

* Narrow and deep focus on {cpp} only
* Uses clang's unstable libtooling API:
** Understands ALL C++: if clang can compile it, MrDocs knows about it
** This includes up to {cpp}20 and even experimental features in {cpp}23
* Brand-new program with no technical debt
* Written by me
