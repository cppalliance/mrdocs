= showrefs

== Syntax
@showrefs

== Description
When this command is put in a comment block of a function or method, then MrDocs will generate an overview for that function or method of the functions and methods that call it. The overview will be generated regardless of the value of REFERENCES_RELATION. 



*Note:* The completeness (and correctness) of the overview depends on the MrDocs code parser which is not perfect.
