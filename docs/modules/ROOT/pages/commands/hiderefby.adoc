= hiderefby

== Syntax
@hiderefby

== Description
When this command is put in a comment block of a function, method or variable then MrDocs will not generate an overview for that function, method or variable of the functions and methods that call / use it. The overview will not be generated regardless of the value of REFERENCED_BY_RELATION. 



*Note:* The completeness (and correctness) of the overview depends on the MrDocs code parser which is not perfect.
