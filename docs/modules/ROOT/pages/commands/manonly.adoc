= manonly

== Syntax
@manonly

== Description
Starts a block of text that only will be verbatim included in the generated MAN documentation and tagged with `<manonly>` in the generated XML output. The block ends with a xref:commands/endmanonly.adoc[@endmanonly] command.

This command can be used to include groff code directly into MAN pages. You can use the xref:commands/htmlonly.adoc[@htmlonly] and xref:commands/endhtmlonly.adoc[@endhtmlonly] and xref:commands/latexonly.adoc[@latexonly] and xref:commands/endlatexonly.adoc[@endlatexonly] pairs to provide proper HTML and LaTeX alternatives.
