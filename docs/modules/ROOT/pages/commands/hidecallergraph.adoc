= hidecallergraph

== Syntax
@hidecallergraph

== Description
When this command is put in a comment block of a function or method and then MrDocs will not generate a caller graph for that function. The caller graph will not be generated regardless of the value of CALLER_GRAPH. 



*Note:* The completeness (and correctness) of the caller graph depends on the MrDocs code parser which is not perfect.
