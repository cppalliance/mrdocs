= author

== Syntax
@author { list of authors }

== Description
Starts a paragraph where one or more author names may be entered. The paragraph will be indented. The text of the paragraph has no special internal structure. All visual enhancement commands may be used inside the paragraph. Multiple adjacent `@author` commands will be joined into a single paragraph. Each author description will start a new line. Alternatively, one `@author` command may mention several authors. The `@author` command ends when a blank line or some other sectioning command is encountered.

== Example
```
/*!
