= line

== Syntax
@line ( pattern )

== Description
This command searches line by line through the example that was last included using xref:commands/include.adoc[@include] or xref:commands/dontinclude.adoc[@dontinclude] until it finds a non-blank line. If that line contains the specified pattern, it is written to the output.

The internal pointer that is used to keep track of the current line in the example, is set to the start of the line following the non-blank line that was found (or to the end of the example if no such line could be found).

See section xref:commands/dontinclude.adoc[@dontinclude] for an example.
