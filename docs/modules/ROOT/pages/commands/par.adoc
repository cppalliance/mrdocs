= par

== Syntax
@par [(paragraph title)] { paragraph }

== Description
If a paragraph title is given this command starts a paragraph with a user defined heading. The heading extends until the end of the line. The paragraph following the command will be indented.

If no paragraph title is given this command will start a new paragraph. This will also work inside other paragraph commands (like xref:commands/param.adoc[@param] or xref:commands/warning.adoc[@warning]) without ending that command.

The text of the paragraph has no special internal structure. All visual enhancement commands may be used inside the paragraph. The `@par` command ends when a blank line or some other sectioning command is encountered.

== Example
```
/*! @class Par_Test
 * Normal text.
 *
 * @par User defined paragraph:
 * Contents of the paragraph.
 *
 * @par
 * New paragraph under the same heading.
 *
 * @note
 * This note consists of two paragraphs.
 * This is the first paragraph.
 *
 * @par
 * And this is the second paragraph.
 *
 * More normal text. 
 */
  
class Par_Test {};

```
