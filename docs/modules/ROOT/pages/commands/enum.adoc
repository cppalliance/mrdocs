= enum

== Syntax
@enum &lt;name&gt;

== Description
Indicates that a comment block contains documentation for an enumeration, with name <name>. If the enum is a member of a class and the documentation block is located outside the class definition, the scope of the class should be specified as well. If a comment block is located directly in front of an enum declaration, the `@enum` comment may be omitted.



*Note:* The type of an anonymous enum cannot be documented, but the values of an anonymous enum can.

== Example
```
class Enum_Test
{
  public:
    enum TEnum { Val1, Val2 };
 
    /*! Another enum, with inline docs */
    enum AnotherEnum 
    { 
      V1, /*!< value 1 */
      V2  /*!< value 2 */
    };
};
 
/*! @class Enum_Test
 * The class description.
 */
 
/*! @enum Enum_Test::TEnum
 * A description of the enum type.
 */
 
/*! @var Enum_Test::TEnum Enum_Test::Val1
 * The description of the first enum value.
 */

```
