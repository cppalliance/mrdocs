= skipline

== Syntax
@skipline ( pattern )

== Description
This command searches line by line through the example that was last included using xref:commands/include.adoc[@include] or xref:commands/dontinclude.adoc[@dontinclude] until it finds a line that contains the specified pattern. It then writes the line to the output.

The internal pointer that is used to keep track of the current line in the example, is set to the start of the line following the line that is written (or to the end of the example if the pattern could not be found).

See section xref:commands/dontinclude.adoc[@dontinclude] for an example.



*Note:* The command: 
```
@skipline pattern
```
 is equivalent to: 
```
@skip pattern
@line pattern
```
