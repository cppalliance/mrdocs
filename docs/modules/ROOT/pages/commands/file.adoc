= file

== Syntax
@file [&lt;name&gt;]

== Description
Indicates that a comment block contains documentation for a source or header file with name <name>. The file name may include (part of) the path if the file-name alone is not unique. If the file name is omitted (i.e. the line after `@file` is left blank) then the documentation block that contains the `@file` command will belong to the file it is located in.



*Important:* The documentation of global functions, variables, typedefs, and enums will only be included in the output if the file they are in is documented as well or if EXTRACT_ALL is set to `YES`.


*Note:* In the above example JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF has been set to `YES` in the configuration file.

== Example
```
/** @file file.h
 * A brief file description.
 * A more elaborated file description.
 */
 
/**
 * A global integer value.
 * More details about this value.
 */
extern int globalValue;

```
