= relatesalso

== Syntax
@relatesalso &lt;name&gt;

== Description
This command can be used in the documentation of a non-member function <name>. It puts the function both inside the 'related function' section of the class documentation as well as leaving it at its normal file documentation location. This command is useful for documenting non-friend functions that are nevertheless strongly coupled to a certain class. It only works for functions.
