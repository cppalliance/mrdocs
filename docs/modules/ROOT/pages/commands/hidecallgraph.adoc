= hidecallgraph

== Syntax
@hidecallgraph

== Description
When this command is put in a comment block of a function or method and then MrDocs will not generate a call graph for that function. The call graph will not be generated regardless of the value of CALL_GRAPH. 



*Note:* The completeness (and correctness) of the call graph depends on the MrDocs code parser which is not perfect.
