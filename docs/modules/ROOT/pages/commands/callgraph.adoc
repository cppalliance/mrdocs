= callgraph

== Syntax
@callgraph

== Description
When this command is put in a comment block of a function or method and HAVE_DOT is set to `YES`, then MrDocs will generate a call graph for that function (provided the implementation of the function or method calls other documented functions). The call graph will be generated regardless of the value of CALL_GRAPH. 



*Note:* The completeness (and correctness) of the call graph depends on the MrDocs code parser which is not perfect.
