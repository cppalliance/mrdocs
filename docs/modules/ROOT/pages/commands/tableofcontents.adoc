= tableofcontents

== Syntax
@tableofcontents['{'[option[:level]][,option[:level]]*'}']

== Description
Creates a table of contents at the top of a page, listing all sections and subsections in the page. The `option` can be `HTML` or `LaTeX` or `XML` or `DocBook`. When a `level` is specified this means the maximum nesting level that is shown. The value of `level` should be in the range 1..6, values outside this range are considered to be 6. In case no `level` is specified `level` is set to 6 (show all) In case no `option`. is specified `@tableofcontents` acts as if just the `option` `HTML` and `XML` was specified. In case of multiple `@tableofcontents` commands in a page the `option`(s) will be used additional to the already specified `option`(s), but only the last `level` of an `option` is valid.
