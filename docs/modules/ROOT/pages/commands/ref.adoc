= ref

== Syntax
@ref &lt;name&gt; ["(text)"]

== Description
Creates a reference to a named symbol, file, section, subsection, page or anchor.

For HTML documentation the reference command will generate a link to the section. For a section or subsection the title of the section will be used as the text of the link. For an anchor the optional text between quotes will be used or <name> if no text is specified.

In case <name> has spaces (for instance if it refers a file name containing spaces) you need to add double quotes around the <name>, e.g. "my file.cpp".

For LaTeX documentation the reference command will be the same unless the PDF_HYPERLINKS option has been set to `NO`, in this case it generates the section title for sections or the text if <name> refers to an anchor followed by a page number.
