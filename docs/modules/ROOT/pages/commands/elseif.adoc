= elseif

== Syntax
@elseif (section-label)

== Description
Starts a conditional documentation section if the previous section was not enabled. A conditional section is disabled by default. To enable it you must put the section-label after the ENABLED_SECTIONS tag in the configuration file. The section label can be a logical expression build of section names, round brackets, && (AND), || (OR) and ! (NOT). Conditional blocks can be nested. A nested section is only enabled if all enclosing sections are enabled as well.
