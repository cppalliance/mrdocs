@verbatim

== Description
Starts a block of text that will be verbatim included in the documentation. The block should end with a xref:commands/endverbatim.adoc[@endverbatim] command. All commands are disabled in a verbatim block.



*Warning:* Make sure you include a xref:commands/endverbatim.adoc[@endverbatim] command for each `@verbatim` command or the parser will get confused!
