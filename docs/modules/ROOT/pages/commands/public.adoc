= public

== Syntax
@public

== Description
Indicates that the member documented by the comment block is public, i.e., can be accessed by any other class or function.

Note that MrDocs automatically detects the protection level of members in object-oriented languages. This command is intended for use only when the language does not support the concept of protection level natively (e.g. C).

For starting a section of public members, in a way similar to the "public:" class marker in C++, use xref:commands/publicsection.adoc[@publicsection].
