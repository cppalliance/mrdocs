= latexonly

== Syntax
@latexonly

== Description
Starts a block of text that only will be verbatim included in the generated LaTeX documentation and tagged with `<latexonly>` in the generated XML output. The block ends with a xref:commands/endlatexonly.adoc[@endlatexonly] command.

This command can be used to include LaTeX code that is too complex for MrDocs (i.e. images, formulas, special characters). You can use the xref:commands/htmlonly.adoc[@htmlonly] and xref:commands/endhtmlonly.adoc[@endhtmlonly] pair to provide a proper HTML alternative.

Note: environment variables (like $(HOME) ) are resolved inside a LaTeX-only block.
