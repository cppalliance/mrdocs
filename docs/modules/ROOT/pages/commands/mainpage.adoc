= mainpage

== Syntax
@mainpage [(title)]

== Description
If the `@mainpage` command is placed in a comment block the block is used to customize the index page (in HTML) or the first chapter (in LaTeX).

The title argument is optional and replaces the default title that MrDocs normally generates. If you do not want any title you can specify `notitle` as the argument of `@mainpage`.

Here is an example:

```
/*! @mainpage My Personal Index Page
 *
 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * This is the introduction.
 *
 * @section install_sec Installation
 *
 * @subsection step1 Step 1: Opening the box
 *
 * etc...
 */

```
// [CODE_END]
You can refer to the main page using: xref:commands/ref.adoc[@ref] index.
