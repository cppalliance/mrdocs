= addtogroup

== Syntax
@addtogroup &lt;name&gt; [(title)]

== Description
Defines a group just like xref:commands/defgroup.adoc[@defgroup], but in contrast to that command using the same <name> more than once will not result in a warning, but rather one group with a merged documentation and the first title found in any of the commands.

The title is optional, so this command can also be used to add a number of entities to an existing group using `@{` and `@}` like this:

```
  /*! @addtogroup mygrp
   *  Additional documentation for group 'mygrp'
   *  @{
   */

  /*!
   *  A function
   */
  void func1()
  {
  }

  /*! Another function */
  void func2()
  {
  }

  /*! @} */

```
