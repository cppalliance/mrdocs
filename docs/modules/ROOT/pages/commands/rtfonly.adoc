= rtfonly

== Syntax
@rtfonly

== Description
Starts a block of text that only will be verbatim included in the generated RTF documentation and tagged with `<rtfonly>` in the generated XML output. The block ends with a xref:commands/endrtfonly.adoc[@endrtfonly] command.

This command can be used to include RTF code that is too complex for MrDocs.

Note: environment variables (like $(HOME) ) are resolved inside a RTF-only block.
