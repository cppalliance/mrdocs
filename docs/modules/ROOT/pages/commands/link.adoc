= link

== Syntax
@link &lt;link-object&gt;

== Description
The links that are automatically generated by MrDocs always have the name of the object they point to as link-text.

The `@link` command can be used to create a link to an object (a file, class, or member) with a user specified link-text. The link command should end with an xref:commands/endlink.adoc[@endlink] command. All text between the `@link` and xref:commands/endlink.adoc[@endlink] commands serves as text for a link to the <link-object> specified as the first argument of `@link`.
