= Usage

== MrDocs invocation

For consistency, these instructions assume you have the following environment variables set:

[source,bash]
----
MRDOCS_ROOT=/path/to/mrdocs
PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR=/path/to/your/project/source
MRDOCS_CONFIG=$PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR/docs/mrdocs.yml
PROJECT_BUILD_DIR=$PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR/build-docs
----

Where `MRDOCS_ROOT` is the path of the mrdocs executable, and `MRDOCS_CONFIG` is the path to the `mrdocs.yml` configuration file.
We also assume `PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR` is the path to the root of your project's source code, where its main `CMakeLists.txt` file is located, and `PROJECT_BUILD_DIR` is the path to the directory where you want to generate the documentation.
Feel free to change these variables to suit your needs.

MrDocs simplifies the documentation generation process. Generating the `compile_commands.json` file by running `cmake` is optional. If the path to `compile_commands.json` is not provided when calling MrDocs, the tool will automatically run `cmake` for you, provided that you have CMake version >=3.13.5 installed. Parameters for cmake, such as `-D BOOST_URL_BUILD_TESTS=OFF`, should be specified in the `cmake:` key of the `mrdocs.yml` configuration file. 

It is still possible, but optional, to manually generate the `compile_commands.json` file. For instructions on manually generating this file, see <<manual-compile-commands, this section>>.


The following command will generate the documentation with the most common options:

[source,bash]
----
cd $PROJECT_BUILD_DIR
MRDOCS_OUTPUT=$PROJECT_BUILD_DIR/docs/reference/adoc
$MRDOCS_ROOT/mrdocs <ProjectPath> --config=$MRDOCS_CONFIG --addons=$MRDOCS_ROOT/addons --output=$MRDOCS_OUTPUT
----

Here's a description of these options:

* `<ProjectPath>`: the path to the project to document. This can be a path to a `compile_commands.json` file, a directory, or a `CMakeLists.txt` file.
If a path to a `compile_commands.json` file is provided, MrDocs will use this file and will not call CMake. It is assumed the user has already manually run CMake.
If a directory (not a file) is provided, it is assumed that this directory is the `ProjectPath` and contains a `CMakeLists.txt` describing the project. MrDocs will automatically run CMake to generate the `compile_commands.json`, using the parameters specified in the `mrdocs.yml` configuration file.
If a `CMakeLists.txt` file is provided, it is assumed that the directory containing this file is the `ProjectPath`. MrDocs will automatically run CMake to generate the `compile_commands.json`, using the parameters specified in the `mrdocs.yml` configuration file.
* `--config=$MRDOCS_CONFIG`: the path to the `mrdocs.yml` configuration file.
This file configures which generator is used, which directory to process,
and what symbols should be extracted.
* `--addons=$MRDOCS_ROOT/addons`: the path to the `addons` directory.
This directory contains the addons that are used to generate the documentation.
Among other things, it contains the default templates for the generator.
This option defaults to current directory if not provided.
* `--output=$MRDOCS_ROOT/output/adoc`: the path to the output directory.
This is where the generated documentation will be placed.

MrDocs ignores non-c++ source files, so nothing more needs to be done to generate the documentation for your project.

[[manual-compile-commands]]
=== Generating the compile_commands.json Manually

To generate the `compile_commands.json` file by running `cmake` with the `-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON` flag.

[source,bash]
----
cd $PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR
mkdir $PROJECT_BUILD_DIR
cd $PROJECT_BUILD_DIR
cmake .. -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON
----

At this step, you can also add any other flags you want to pass to `cmake`, such as `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` or `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++`.
By running CMake with the `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS` flag, you will generate a `compile_commands.json` file in your build directory.
This file contains all the information mrdocs needs to generate the documentation.

== Demos

A few examples of reference documentation generated with MrDocs are available in https://mrdocs.com/demos/.

== MrDocs configuration file

The `mrdocs.yml` configuration file contains information about the project that is not available in the `compile_commands.json` file or from the command line.
The most important information is the `source-root` options, which determines the root of the source tree relative to the `mrdocs.yml` file.

Other options are available, such as the `concurrency` option, which determines the number of threads mrdocs will use to generate the documentation.
This option defaults to the number of cores available on the machine.

[source,yaml]
----
concurrency: 1      # number of threads to use
source-root: ../    # source files relative to the mrdocs.yml file
multipage: false    # generate multiple pages
verbose: true       # print verbose output
----

== MrDocs CMake Module

MrDocs also provides a CMake module that can be used to generate the documentation from your project's script.
You can include the CMake module with:

[source,cmake]
----
find_package(MrDocs REQUIRED)
# ...
include(MrDocs)
----

The module will define the `add_mrdocs` function, which can be used define a CMake target that generates the documentation for your project.
The syntax is similar to other cmake functions, such as `add_executable` or `add_library`:

[source,cmake]
----
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES ${CMAKE_CXX_IMPLICIT_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES})
add_mrdocs(<name>
    [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL]
    [CONFIG <mrdocs.yml>]
    [ADDONS <addons-dir>]
    [COMMENT comment]
    [OUTPUT <output-dir>]
    [<source>...])
----

The function adds a custom target called `<name>` which builds the documentation the source files listed in the command invocation.
The `<name>` corresponds to the logical target name and must be globally unique within a project.

* If `EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL` is given the corresponding property will be set on the created target.
See documentation of the https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_tgt/EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL.html[`EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`] target property for details.

* The `CONFIG` option specifies the path to the `mrdocs.yml` configuration file.
If not specified, the function will look for the configuration file in your project directory.

* The `ADDONS` option specifies a custom path to the `addons` directory. By default, the function will use the `addons` directory in the MrDocs installation directory.

* The `OUTPUT` option specifies the path to the output directory.
If not specified, the function will use the default output directory, which is relative to the current binary directory.
The complete default path is constructed based on the current binary directory and the options passed to the command (such as `docs/adoc`).

* The `COMMENT` option specifies a comment that will be displayed when the target is built.
If not specified, the comment will be generated automatically according to the input options.

The `<source>` arguments specify files on which the generated documentation depends.
The custom target will depend on these source files.
This means if these files are created with other `add_custom_command()` command calls in the same directory, they will be brought up to date when the target is built.
