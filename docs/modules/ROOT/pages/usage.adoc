= Basic Usage

The diagram below illustrates the workflow of the MrDocs documentation tool.
It shows how inputs are transformed step by step into the final documentation output.
Each component in the diagram represents a distinct type of entity:

- **Inputs**: Provide the initial parameters and settings required to configure and run the tool.
These include the <<config-file,configuration file>> and <<cli,command-line arguments>>.
- **Processes**: Represent intermediary outputs or data generated during the workflow.
- **Outputs**: The final product, in this case, the generated documentation.

include::partial$workflow.adoc[]

In summary:

* Begin by specifying the <<config-file,configuration file>> and <<cli,command-line arguments>> to set up the options.
The configuration options affect all processes.
* The configuration options define a <<compilation-database, Compilation Database>>.
All symbols are extracted with Clang to generate a unified corpus of symbols with their corresponding xref:page$commands.adoc[documentation].
* Finally, This corpus is then fed to a xref:page$generators.adoc[Generator] that produces the desired documentation.

For more details on each component, refer to the corresponding sections of this guide.

[#config-file]
== MrDocs configuration file

The `mrdocs.yml` configuration file contains information about the project.
If you're used to Doxygen, this file is similar to the `Doxyfile` configuration file.

Here is an example of a `mrdocs.yml` file:

[source,yaml]
--------
include::partial$mrdocs-example.yml[]
--------

In many projects, it is common to have the documentation in a `docs` directory, which can also contain this configuration file.

[source]
----
+ <project-directory>
  + docs
    + mrdocs.yml
    + ...
  + include
  + src
  + test
  + ...
----

The most important information is the `source-root` option, which determines the root of the source tree relative to the `mrdocs.yml` file.

The list of all available options can be found in the xref:config-file.adoc[] page.

[#cli]
== MrDocs invocation

NOTE: For consistency, these instructions assume you have the `mrdocs` executable in PATH.

=== Basic invocation

You can invoke MrDocs from the command line with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
mrdocs path/to/mrdocs.yml
----

If you are at the path of the `mrdocs.yml` file, you can simply run:

[source,bash]
----
mrdocs
----

You can also specify other commands to MrDocs directly from the command line to set or override options from the `mrdocs.yml` file (See all options in xref:config-file.adoc[] page).

[source,bash]
----
mrdocs path/to/mrdocs.yml --output=../docs/reference
----

NOTE: Except for the path to the `mrdocs.yml` file, all other relative paths are made absolute relative to the `mrdocs.yml` file.

[#compilation-database]
=== Compilation databases

One way to simplify the documentation generation process is by using a `compile_commands.json` file generated by CMake to determine the source files to process and their compile options.
This file is generated by the CMake configuration step when the `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS` option is set to `ON`.

[source,bash]
----
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON
----

At this step, you can also add any other flags you want to pass to `cmake`, such as `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` or `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++`.

NOTE: If you are using the Visual Studio generator, you might need to switch to the Ninja generator to generate the `compile_commands.json` file.

This will generate a `compile_commands.json` file in the `build` directory containing all commands needed to compile your project.
This file can be used by MrDocs to determine the source files to process and their compile options.

[source,bash]
----
mrdocs --compilation-database=../build/compile_commands.json --output=../docs/reference
----

MrDocs will go through all the source files listed in the `compile_commands.json` file and generate the documentation for them.

WARNING: When MrDocs goes through the commands in the compilation database, it will go through the same targets as the compiler.
Only symbols present in these targets will be documented.
In the case of header-only libraries, the symbols will be documented only if they are included in one of these targets.

=== CMake integration

It's common to have different configurations for the documentation generation than for the project build.
This means CMake is often being run just to generate a custom `compile_commands.json` for the documentation.
Also, the `compile_commands.json` file is a configuration artifact, which means it often lacks a stable location that can be referenced in the `mrdocs.yml` configuration file.

Thus, the pattern of using a `compile_commands.json` file generated by CMake is so common that MrDocs provides a CMake module to simplify the process.
You can let MrDocs generate the `compile_commands.json` file for you by providing the path to the `CMakeLists.txt` file of your project.

[source,bash]
----
mrdocs --compilation-database=../CMakeLists.txt --output=../docs/reference
----

By providing your `CMakeLists.txt` file as the reference for you compilation database, MrDocs will automatically run CMake to generate the `compile_commands.json` file in a temporary directory.
Not only this simplifies the usage but also ensures that the stable compilation database file can be used in the `mrdocs.yml` configuration file.

NOTE: MrDocs does not bundle CMake.
If you want to use this feature, you need to have CMake installed on your system and available in PATH.

Parameters for cmake, such as `-D BUILDING_TEST=OFF -D MRDOCS_BUILD=ON` can also be specified with the `cmake` option in configuration file.
MrDocs will always append the `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON` flag to the cmake command.

=== MrDocs Builds

In many projects, a common pattern is to define a special build configuration for the documentation generation such that:

1. Tests, examples, and auxiliary targets excluded
2. All header-only files are included in targets
3. Unnecessary sources files are excluded from targets

This can usually be achieved by defining a custom target in the `CMakeLists.txt` with a single source file that includes all the necessary header files.

[source,cmake]
----
if (MY_PROJECT_MRDOCS_BUILD)
    # Glob all header files
    set(INCLUDE_DIR "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include")
    file(GLOB_RECURSE HEADER_FILES "${INCLUDE_DIR}/*.hpp")

    # Create a temporary source file that includes all header files
    set(TEMP_CPP_FILE "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/all_headers.cpp")
    file(WRITE ${TEMP_CPP_FILE} "// This file is generated automatically by CMake\n\n")
    foreach(HEADER_FILE ${HEADER_FILES_LIST})
        file(APPEND ${TEMP_CPP_FILE} "#include \"${HEADER_FILE}\"\n")
    endforeach()

    # Create a custom target for MrDocs
    add_library(my_project_mrdocs_target ${TEMP_CPP_FILE})

    # Set any other target properties here
    target_include_directories(my_project_mrdocs_target PRIVATE ${INCLUDE_DIR})
    target_link_libraries(my_project_mrdocs_target PRIVATE an_external_library)

    # Don't create any other targets
    return()
endif()
----

To use this target, you can run CMake with the `MY_PROJECT_MRDOCS_BUILD` flag set to `ON`:

[source,bash]
----
mrdocs --cmake="-D MY_PROJECT_MRDOCS_BUILD=ON" --compilation-database=../CMakeLists.txt --output=..\docs\reference
----

Because these paths and options are stable, you can specify them in the `mrdocs.yml` configuration file.

[source,yaml]
----
cmake: "-D MY_PROJECT_MRDOCS_BUILD=ON"
compilation-database: ../CMakeLists.txt
output: ../docs/reference
----

== Extracting Documentation

Unlike other documentation generators, MrDocs only works with valid {cpp} code.
Instead of partially preprocessing the source files and inferring symbols from potentially ill-formed code, MrDocs relies on the compilation database and Clang to preprocess the source files.

Thus, for each common {cpp} construct, MrDocs provides commands or options to identify and extract the relevant information as intended by the user.
For instance, a common ill-formed Doxygen pattern to specify a class as an implementation detail is:

[source,c++]
----
#ifdef DOCS
__implementation_defined__
#else
impl::f_return_t
#endif
f();
----

In this pattern, the user wants to document the function `f` as `__implementation_defined__ f();` because the library contract is that the user should not rely on a specific return type here.
However, this ill-formed pattern is problematic:

* `&lowbar;&lowbar;implementation&lowbar;defined&lowbar;&lowbar;` is not a valid symbol so the code is ill-formed
* `impl::f&lowbar;return&lowbar;t` doesn't express the intent of the user for the documentation
* the developer has to effectively maintain two versions of the code
* the original source code becomes more and more unreadable

Instead, when using MrDocs, while the `\\&lowbar;&lowbar;MRDOCS&lowbar;&lowbar;` macro is still available for conditional compilation, the same function could be directly documented as:

[source,c++]
----
impl::f_return_t f();
----

And the user can specify that symbols in the `impl` namespace are implementation details in the configuration file:

[source,yaml]
----
# ...
implementation-detail: impl::**
# ...
----

The xref:commands.adoc[] and xref:config-file.adoc[] pages contain a list of all available commands and options to identify and extract the relevant information as intended by the user.

MrDocs provides multiple mechanisms are provided to specify special {cpp} patterns, such as the example above.
For each common {cpp} construct that would require macros and two versions of the code, MrDocs provides commands to identify the construct and extract the relevant information as intented by the user.

[#dependencies]
=== Dependencies

Another consequence of relying on valid {cpp} code is that MrDocs needs to know about dependencies of the project for the code to be valid. In particular, it needs access to the header files of the project and its dependencies.

The `includes` option in the configuration file specifies the directories to search for header files. Suppose a library depends on an external library, such as https://www.boost.org[Boost,window=_blank]:

[source,yaml]
----
# A library that depends on an external library
includes:
  - /path/to/boost/include
----

Whatever is specified in the `includes` option is passed to Clang as include directories, regardless of the strategy used to generate the compilation database.

If a `compile_commands.json` file is used, these include directories are passed directly to Clang as `-I` flags.

If a `CMakeLists.txt` file is used, the `cmake` option in the configuration file can be used to provide the necessary parameters for CMake to find the appropriate header files.

[source,yaml]
----
cmake: '-D BOOST_ROOT=/path/to/boost'
----

Another option supported by CMake is to set the `BOOST_ROOT` environment variable as `/path/to/boost` before running MrDocs.

=== System dependencies

It's also common for libraries to depend on the C++ standard library, the C standard library, or other system libraries. These dependencies are usually resolved by the compiler and are not explicitly specified in the source code:

* The {cpp} standard library: The compiler will look for specific paths according to the `-stdlib` option and include them as implicit `-isystem` paths. For instance, Clang can use different implementations of the {cpp} standard library. By default, that's Microsoft STL on Windows, libstdc&plus;&plus; on Linux and libc&plus;&plus; otherwise. This can be disabled with `-nostdinc&plus;&plus; -nostdlib&plus;&plus;` or, in MrDocs, with `use-system-stdlib=false`.
* The C standard library (and system libraries): Unlike with libc&plus;&plus;, LLVM&plus;Clang does not provide an implementation of the C standard library. It always depends on the system for that. The compiler will not look for specific paths but implicitly include all system libraries. This can be disabled with `-nostdinc` or, in MrDocs, with `use-system-libc=false`.

That means unless `-nostdinc` is defined, all systems include paths are included. This is what allows the user to also use headers like `<Windows.h>` or `<linux/version.h>` without explicitly including anything else, even though they are not part of the C standard library. This is often seen as a convenience but can lead to portability issues.

In this context, MrDocs provides the `use-system-stdlib` and `use-system-libc` options. Both are set as `false` by default, meaning MrDocs will compile the code as if the `-nostdinc&plus;&plus; -nostdlib&plus;&plus;` and `-nostdinc` flags were passed to Clang. Additionally:

- When `use-system-stdlib` is `false`, MrDocs will use the bundled libc&plus;&plus; headers available in `<mrdocs-root>/share/mrdocs/headers/libcxx` and `<mrdocs-root>/share/mrdocs/headers/clang`. These paths can be adjusted with the `stdlib-includes` option.
- When `use-system-libc` is `false`, MrDocs will use the bundled libc stubs available in `<mrdocs-root>/share/mrdocs/headers/libc-stubs`. This path can be adjusted with the `libc-includes` option.

The rationale for that is reproducibility. You want to be able to build your documentation and don't want it to stop working because the platform or some platform details have changed.
These default values also help avoid conflicts where the same symbol or header is defined twice if the compilation database includes system paths relevant to one specific compiler. That can  breaks things when MrDocs attempts to compile it with clang.
In other words, MrDocs becomes a sandboxed environment where only the C and C++ standard libraries are available.

The default values described above work for most libraries and applications that only depend on the C and C++ standard libraries. When there are no dependencies outside the standard libraries, the user probably won't even notice the difference between these options.

However, if you depend on other system libraries, that means you need to handle these dependencies explicitly. For instance, this is very common with networking libraries. There are a few solutions to this, and these solutions are in a continuum regarding the use of `use-system-stdlib`/`use-system-libc` and the design of the code:

1. Depending on the design of your library, you can implement a different path for MrDocs where you don't need these system headers. System headers are often guarded by macros to detect the platform: for instance, `&lowbar;&lowbar;linux&lowbar;&lowbar;` for `<linux/version.h>` and `&lowbar;WIN32` for `<Windows.h>`. You can use the `&lowbar;&lowbar;MRDOCS&lowbar;&lowbar;` macro to provide an implementation for MrDocs. This implementation would typically include stubs for the symbols you need in the documentation. Because symbols from system libraries are typically not exposed in the public API of your library, that gives you replacements that make sense for the documentation. However, this solution is not enough when other dependencies also depend on these system libraries.
2. Handle it as an explicit dependency. Explicitly include the paths you need in your compilation database as if it's a dependency described in the <<dependencies>> section. For instance, you can get CMake to explicitly find `<linux/version.h>` or `<Windows.h>` and only include those directories with `-isystem` or `-I` in the compilation database.
3. Enable `use-system-libc`. MrDocs will still use the bundled libc&plus;&plus; for the C&plus;&plus; standard library, and use the system headers for the C standard library, making all system paths available. That makes system headers such as `<linux/version.h>` or `<Windows.h>` available by default. The trade-off is losing the reproducibility guarantees described above.

The first option in this list provides the most control and the most reproducibility. The third option is the most convenient but also the most fragile.
