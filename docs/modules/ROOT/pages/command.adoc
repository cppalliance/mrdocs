= Invocation

`mrdox` is a single executable, that can be invoked as follows:

[source,bash]
----
mrdox --config config.yml my_source.cpp
----

Where config.yml is the mrdox specific configuration.

Note that `mrdox` will look for a `compile_commands.json` file in the current directory,
known as the compile databasefootnote:[The easiest way to obtain the compile database is with cmake's
    https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS.html::[CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS]].

The compile database file can be changed by using `-p`, i.e.:


[source,bash]
----
mrdox -p my_comile_commands.json --config config.yml my_source.cpp
----

=== Cmake script

The mrdox.cmake script provides a `mrdox` command,
that assumes `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS` is set for the whole project.

[source,cmake]
----
        mrdox(FORMAT adoc CONFIG docs/mrdox.yml SOURCES my_source.cpp)
----

which will generate a `reference.adoc` file.
