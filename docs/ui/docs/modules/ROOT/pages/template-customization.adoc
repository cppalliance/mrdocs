= Template Customization

The default UI bundle can be customized using AsciiDoc attributes.
xref:templates.adoc[] explains how to access such attributes.
But what are the attributes that actually used by the templates.
If you're going to use the default UI bundle for your project, you'll want to know.

== page-role attribute

The `page-role` attribute is typically defined per-page.
This attribute is used to add one or more space-separated classes to the `<body>` tag of that page.

A common use of the `page-role` attribute is to label the home page.

[,asciidoc]
----
= Home
:page-role: home

This is the home page.
----

////
Alternately, the role can be set on the document itself.

[,asciidoc]
----
[.home]
= Home

This is the home page.
----
////

The resulting HTML will include the following `<body>` start tag:

[,html]
----
<body class="article -toc">
----

The stylesheet can now take advantage of this identity to assign styles to pages that have a given role.
For example, the home page often requires a different appearance.
Being able to target that page with CSS allows UI developers to apply that customization.

Note that the UI templates could make use of the page role in other ways.
The default UI currently only appends the value to the `class` attribute on the `<body>` tag.

=== Hide the TOC sidebar

The one reserved page role that the default UI recognizes is `-toc`.
This role instructs the site script to remove (i.e., hide) the TOC sidebar.
Here's how to set it.

[,asciidoc]
----
= Page Title
:page-role: -toc

The TOC sidebar is not displayed even though this page has sections.

== First Section

== Second Section
----

The AsciiDoc `toc` attribute controls whether the TOC is rendered in the *body* of the article.
Since the default UI provides an alternate TOC, you most likely don't want to activate the built-in TOC functionality in AsciiDoc when using Antora.

== page-pagination attribute

The `page-pagination` attribute is set in your xref:antora:playbook:asciidoc-attributes.adoc[playbook] in order to enable pagination, if your UI bundle supports it.
The default UI bundle supports this and you'll get the links to previous and next pages at the bottom of every page, based your navigation.

.Enable pagination
[,yaml]
----
asciidoc:
  attributes:
    page-pagination: ''
----

Antora automatically calculates the appropriate URLs and inserts the correct links.

Since you most likely want this enabled for every page in your site, there's no point setting this attribute per page.
However, if you do want to be able to override it per page, such as to turn it off, then you need to soft set the value in the playbook.

.Enable pagination, but make it overriddable
[,yaml]
----
asciidoc:
  attributes:
    page-pagination: '@'
----

You can now turn page pagination off by unsetting the `page-pagination` attribute in the document header.
