= GDB pretty printers

Create or modify your `.gdbinit` file to contain the following:

[source,python]
----
python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '/path/share/gdb') <1>
from mrdox_printers import register_mrdox_printers <2>
register_mrdox_printers() <3>
end
----

<1> Make GDB see the directory with the printers
<2> Import the function that registers the printers with GDB
<3> Effectively register the printers

Note that this pattern does not register the printers unless the user explicitly asks for it by calling the `register_mrdox_printers` function.
This helps the scripts separate these concerns.

NOTE: The printers require Python 3
