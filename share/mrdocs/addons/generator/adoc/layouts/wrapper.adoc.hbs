{{!--
    Wraps the documentation for a symbol (multipage) or all symbols (single page).

    The {{{contents}}} tag can be used to include the content of the symbol or symbols
    to be wrapped by this template.

    The multipage mode, the wrapper also receives the symbol object to render the title
    and the breadcrumbs.

    In the single page mode, the symbol object is not available to the wrapper, but it
    is available to the symbol template. In this case, the title is simply "Reference".

    As Antora does not support relative links to pages in parent directories, the
    relfileprefix attribute is set to make all links relative to the root directory.
    This is only necessary in multipage mode.
