{{!
    Antora does not support relative links to pages in
    parent directories. Therefore, unlike in HTML templates,
    links are not relativized.

    However, while Antora interprets xref as relative
    to the root of the module, these xref are
    interpreted as relative to the current directory
    because it has no concept of modules. This means
    links would be broken with either Antora or Asciidoc.

    Even more, Antora uses the same rule as Asciidoc
    for breadcrumbs and the page title, where links
    would also be broken.

    The solution is to set the relfileprefix attribute,
    which includes the relative location of the root
    directory and makes all links relative to it.

    This relfileprefix affects Asciidoc links, the
    Antora title, and the Antora breadcrumbs.
