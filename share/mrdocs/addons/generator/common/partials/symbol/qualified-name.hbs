{{!--
    Renders the qualified symbol name in an appropriate format for section titles.

    This partial renders the symbol name in a format where all parent namespaces
    are linked to their documentation. The symbol name is then appended to the
    linked namespaces.

    It also includes exceptions for unnamed symbols and friend declarations.
    Unnamed symbols need to be handled differently as they have no name to display.
    Friend declarations need to be handled differently as they are not part of the
    symbol hierarchy and need to be linked to the befriended symbol or type.

    Expected Context: {Symbol Object}

    Example:
        {{> symbol/qualified-name symbol }}
